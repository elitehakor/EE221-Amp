Michael played around with multisim and created different circuit schematics for
orders first through fourth.

We started building the 4th order circuit, starting with the resistors

We picked out 6 resistor types to make the 4 required resistors:
    - 9k1 + 220
    - 6k2 + 1k
    - 18k
    - 10k

This will translate to 18 total resistors on our board.

We found out that the cylinder capacitors should not be used for AC voltage.
Therefore, we went ahead and bought the ceramic capacitors.

We decided to still build the circuit, using the cylinder caps as placeholders.
When the ceramic capacitors come in, we will replace them.
